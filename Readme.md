# Design Patterns 
-----

At any given moment, someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. 
And, chances are, someone else has already solved your problem.

This repo aim to be a quick software design concepts reference.

The examples are implemented on Typescript.

## Design Principles

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them  from what stays the same.
- Program to an super type (interface), not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritnce.

## Design Patterns

- ### __Strategy Pattern__
  Define a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. 
  Strategy  lets the alghoritm vary independently from clients that use it
